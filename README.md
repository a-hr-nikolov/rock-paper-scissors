A rock-paper-scissors game vs the computer

## **Ver. 1:**

First, I created a function to determine the computer's choice. Then I wrote a function to play a single round of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Finally, I made a function, which runs five rounds of the game and keeps track of the score.

**Note:** The current code to keep track is very simple. I have one winnerTrack variable which is either incremented or decremented depending on who wins the round. The function then returns the result based on that variable.

### **Possible Improvements:**

1. Trackers can be added to keep the score of each player.
2. Some if-statements can be refactored with ternary operators.

## **Ver. 2:**

I added UI elements so that the game can be played properly, not within the console.

I also added functionality that wasn't there before. Here is what you can do in the game now:

1. You have a start screen on initial page load.
2. You click buttons to make your choice. The buttons are icons, not text, and they are also slightly animated.
3. After the game ends, it can be reloaded, without refreshing the page.
4. The computer choice is now displayed properly, it isn't simply stated in the results box.

### **Possible Improvements:**

1. ~~The computer choice can also be shown through icons.~~
2. The design can be made more responsive, especially for smaller screens.
3. The whole thing can be made slightly better looking, though I actually like how it looks right now.
