A rock-paper-scissors game vs the computer

## **Ver. 1:**

First, I created a function to determine the computer's choice. Then I wrote a function to play a single round of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Finally, I made a function, which runs five rounds of the game and keeps track of the score.

**Note:** The current code to keep track is very simple. I have one winnerTrack variable which is either incremented or decremented depending on who wins the round. The function then returns the result based on that variable.

### **Possible Improvements:**

1. Trackers can be added to keep the score of each player.
2. The game may optionally run with two players, instead of the computer.
3. Some if-statements can be refactored with ternary operators.
